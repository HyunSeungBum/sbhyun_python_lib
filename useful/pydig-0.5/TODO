Todo List (ie. things I might implement in the future)

* do more Pythonic things
  - re-architect to use more OOP classes
  - use "warn" module to issue warnings
  - return instance of an options class rather than a dictionary in 
    parse_args()?
  - breakup script into script and a module.py file

* Implement +trace --> iterative resolution
* Use some python module for better options parsing (which one?)
* More graceful error messages in command line parsing - give
  better feedback about exception raised
* Make sure TSIG record in response is the last record in additional section
* Decode old-style DNSSEC RR types: KEY, SIG, NXT
* Support IDN
* Try additional nameservers from /etc/resolv.conf if necessary
* Support IXFR queries, by means of syntax 'ixfr=NNN'
* Support SIG(0) channel security mechanism
* Validate DNSSEC secured data via configured trust anchors
* Decode DKIM
* Implement DNSSEC validation
