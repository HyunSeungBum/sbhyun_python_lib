Program:	pydig (a DNS query tool written in Python)
Version:	0.5
Written by:	Shumon Huque <shuque@upenn.edu>

Description:

	A small python program to perform DNS queries. It works mostly 
	similarly to the dig program that comes with Bind. I wrote it 
	mostly for fun, while trying to understand DNSSEC. And in general, 
	for most queries, there is no reason to use it in preference to 
	dig. However, it does a few things differently that I needed from 
	time to time, such as: optionally presenting a hexdump of the 
	resource data rather than decoding it; decoding the exponent in 
	a RSA/SHA-1 DNSKEY; printing out names of DNSSEC related crypto 
	hashes and algorithms; counting how many compression references 
	were followed; implementing the 0x20 bit case randomization hack;
	providing more detailed statistics on TSIG authenticated zone
	transfers, etc. It also has an option to walk a DNSSEC secured 
	zone and enumerate all its resource records - this only works on
	NSEC zones.

	RR type and class codes (qtype and qclass) unknown to this 
	program can be specified with the TYPE123 and CLASS123 syntax.

	This program is self contained, doesn't need to be installed
	in any particular location, and doesn't depend on any 3rd
	party modules. All it needs is a recent version of Python (and
	its standard library).

Usage:

	pydig [list of options] <qname> [<qtype>] [<qclass>]
	pydig @server +walk <zone>

Options:

        -h                        print program usage information
        @server                   server to query
        -pNN                      use port NN
        +tcp                      send query via TCP
        +aaonly                   set authoritative answer bit
        +cdflag                   set checking disabled bit
        +norecurse                set rd bit to 0 (recursion not desired)
        +edns0                    use EDNS0 with 4096 octet UDP payload
        +dnssec                   request DNSSEC RRs in response
        +hex                      print hexdump of rdata field
        +walk                     walk (enumerate) a DNSSEC secured zone
	+0x20			  randomize case of query name (bit 0x20 hack)
        -4                        perform queries with IPv4
        -6                        perform queries with IPv6
        -d                        request additional debugging output
	-k/path/to/keyfile        use TSIG key in specified file
        -iNNN                     use specified message id
        -tNNN                     use this TSIG timestamp (secs since epoch)
        -y<alg>:<name>:<key>      use specified TSIG alg, name, key

Example usage:

       pydig www.example.com
       pydig www.example.com A
       pydig www.example.com A IN
       pydig @10.0.1.2 example.com MX
       pydig @dns1.example.com _blah._tcp.foo.example.com SRV
       pydig @192.168.42.6 +dnssec +norecurse blah.example.com NAPTR
       pydig @dns2.example.com -6 +hex www.example.com
       pydig @192.168.72.3 +walk secure.example.com
       pydig @192.168.14.7 -yhmac-md5:my.secret.key.:YWxidXMgZHVtYmxlZG9yZSByaWNoYXJkIGRhd2tpbnM= example.com axfr

Limitations:

	Expects well formed (ie. correct) DNS responses. Otherwise 
	it will likely generate an exception and terminate itself
	ungracefully.

	Certain combinations of options don't make any sense (eg.
	+tcp and +edns0). pydig doesn't bother to check that, and 
	just ignores the nonsensical ones. Certain options also 
	imply other options, eg. +walk and +dnssec imply +edns0.

	For TSIG (Transaction Signature) signed messages,  only  the
        manadatory-to-implement HMAC-MD5 TSIG signature algorithm is
        supported.

	It does not yet verify signatures in DNSSEC secured data.

	It does not perform iterative resolution (eg. dig's +trace).

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.3 (or later)

Platforms:

	Tested on the following platforms:
		Solaris 8, 9, 10, and 11
		Linux 2.x
		Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.7

	and with Python 2.3 - 2.7

Installation:

	1. (as root) make install
